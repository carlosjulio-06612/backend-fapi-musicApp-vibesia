# 📁 API v1 Endpoints

FastAPI modules that define the system's main routes:

- `auth.py`: Registration, login, tokens.
- `users.py`: User management.
- `artist.py`, `song.py`: CRUD for artists and songs.
- `playlist.py`: Create, update, delete playlists.
- `password.py`: Change password.

All routes are automatically documented via OpenAPI.
